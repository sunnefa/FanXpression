        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>All you need to install FanXpression is Apache, PHP and MySQL. If you're not sure whether PHP and MySQL are installed on your server, ask you hosting company.</p>
        <p>You also need to be a big fan of something, a celebrity, movie, band, book, sports team or anything else you can think of.</p>

        <a name="installing"></a>
        <h2>Installing FanXpression</h2>
        <p>After you've downloaded FanXpression, unzip the archive and upload everything to the public_html (in some cases htdocs or www) folder on your server. Make sure all the files were uploaded correctly.</p>
        <p>To install FanXpression navigate to http://www.whateveryourdomain.is/install.php and follow the instructions.</p>
        <p>You will need to know your database username, database password, database name and host name. You can get these through your cPanel (if you have one) or by asking your hosting company.</p>
        <p>If the install failed for some reason, delete all the folders in your fanx_uploads folder (if there are any), remove all the database tables that may have been created from your database (if you don't know how to do this you can ask your host to do it for you) and attempt the install again.</p>

        <a name="themes"></a>
        <h2>Themes</h2>
        <p>To make your own theme, you can either start from scratch or duplicate the default theme and edit it.</p>
        <p>In addition to the functions listed below, you can of course use any PHP functions you wish in your theme.</p>
        <h3>Theme files</h3>
        <p>The following files are mandatory for a theme to work. If the file is not found in the selected theme, a file from the default theme will be used instead.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>
            	<strong>header.php</strong>
                <p>This file is where you put all your header code, the start of your html and body tags, your header, title and meta tags and include any css style sheets or javascript files you are going to use. This is also file in which the main navigation is, and a good place to put a top banner.</p>
                <p>The following functions are available in this file:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>
                    	<em>main_menu()</em>
                    	<p>This function prints the main navigation menu, with a link to the home page (if you wish) and any supercategories you have created as well as active sections if they have not been sorted into a supercategory. This function takes an optional argument, where you can specify which tags to put before the whole menu, which tags to put after the whole menu and which tags to put before and after each link.</p>
                        <p>Example: </p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php main_menu(array(
    'before_menu' => '&lt;ul class="menu"&gt;',
    'after_menu' => '&lt;/ul&gt;',
    'before_link' => '&lt;li&gt;',
    'after_link' => '&lt;/li&gt;',
    'include_home_link' => true
)); ?&gt;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following variables are available in this file: </p>

                	<li><em>$site_title</em> - This variable holds the title of the site as per your settings as well as the title of the current page, post, category or section being viewed.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>To be able to use these variables you will need to use PHP's echo function. Example:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;?php echo $site_title; ?&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>You can use echo inside any html structure you choose. If you are unsure, you can use the default theme as a reference.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <ol>
        	<li>
            	<p>Q: What is FanXpression?</p>
            	<p>A: FanXpression is a content management system intended to be used to create fansites (though if you can think of other uses, by all means go for it). It has several features that allow fansite webmasters to more easily manage their fansite, such as themes, posts, pages and different sections, such as discography.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            	<p>Q: Who can use FanXpression?</p>
                <p>A: Anyone who would like to create a fansite can use FanXpression. You only have to make sure your server meets all the <a href="#requirements">Requirements</a>  before you start using it.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            	<p>Q: What are extensions?</p>
                <p>A: Extensions are a way for you to extend the functionality of FanXpression by adding little extra bits. As of version 1.0 Beta, the adding of new extensions is not possible, but FanXpression comes with one extension installed, discography.</p>
                <p>In the future, the plan is to make more of those, allowing webmasters to only install the extensions they need (eg. you wouldn't need functionality for discography if your fansite is about a book).</p>
